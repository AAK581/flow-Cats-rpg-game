 * ============================================================================
 *                             FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 *  • M01: Excess subject hit rate reduces target's evade chance.
 *         Formula: EVA ↦ 1 - (1 - EVA) * HIT.
 *         This is only applied when HIT > 100% and EVA < 100%.
 *         E.g. 120% HIT vs 20% EVA:
 *           - Original = 20% evade chance.
 *           - Adjusted = 1 - (1 - 0.2) * 1.2 = 1 - 0.96 = 4% evade chance.
 *
 *  • M02: Affects how player values are affected on exiting a vehicle.
 *         Normally speed is reset to 4, and Through is set to OFF.
 *         This feature restores the pre-vehicle speed/Through values instead.
 *
 *  • M03: Extends the Target Rate Sp-param, a.k.a. "TGR".
 *         Only affects opponent-scoped actions that are not Certain Hit.
 *         If there are multiple potential targets:
 *           - The candidate with highest TGR is identified.
 *           - "Taunt" = "Highest TGR" / "TGR Factor" (plugin parameter).
 *           - Eligible candidates have TGR >= "Taunt".
 *           - Ineligible candidates cannot be aimed at.
 *             They can still be hit by AoE scope skills, e.g. "All Enemies".
 *
 *  • M04: States with a <persist> notetag will remain after death.
 *
 *  • M05: States with a <next: X, Y> notetag may also add state X on apply.
 *         Requirements for this are:
 *           - Tagged state is at max turns after being applied.
 *           - Random roll [0, 1) is less than Y times the target's state rate.
 *         E.g. <next: 5, 0.2> => 20% chance to add state 5.
 *
 *  • M06: Blank equip type names count as the preceding non-blank equip type.
 *         This allows equipping the same equip type in multiple slots.
 *         Applies to Database > Types > Equip Types.
 *         Examples:
 *           - "Weapon", "Shield", "Ring", "", "Amulet".
 *               Defines slots: Weapon, Shield, Ring, Ring, Amulet.
 *           - "WPN", "OFF", "ORB", "", "", "CHA", "".
 *               Defines slots: WPN, OFF, ORB, ORB, ORB, CHA, CHA.
 *
 *  • M07: The luck effect is based on relative luck values (subject/target).
 *         It normally only affects state/debuff apply chance.
 *         This feature lets the luck effect multiply other things:
 *           - Hit chance (except for Certain Hit actions).
 *           - Crit chance.
 *           - Counter Attack chance.
 *           - Magic Reflect chance.
 *           - Enemy item drop chance.
 *           - Enemy gold drop quantity.
 *           - Battle escape chance.
 *         Default luck effect grants +0.1%pt favour per +1 LUK difference.
 *         Unit-based effects (item/gold/escape) use mean of pairwise values.
 *
 *  • M08: Makes TP work as a damage shield: 1 TP blocks 1 damage.
 *         Designed to work with M09 (max TP from notetags).
 *
 *         Only affects damage from a Skill/Item damage formula.
 *         Disables default "charge TP by damage" mechanic.
 *         Optional sub-features (see plugin parameters):
 *           - show popups for blocked damage.
 *           - show battle log messages.
 *           - show block and/or break animations.
 *           - in battle, init TP to max instead of random 0~24.
 *
 *  • M09: Specify max TP with notetags on trait-bearing objects:
 *           - <max TP base: X>
 *               Base value for max TP. Overrides default (plugin parameter).
 *               If multiple tags apply, the largest value is used.
 *           - <max TP plus: X>
 *               Additional value for max TP.
 *               All plus values are added to the base.
 *
 *  • M10: Normally the engine forbids changing input actor in TPB-Wait mode.
 *         This is now allowed when appropriate, via cancel.
 *         Also adds left/right input options for changing input actor.
 *
 *  • M11: Allows changing between Active and Wait TPB modes mid-game, via:
 *           - In-game option: leave display name blank to omit;
 *           - Plugin command: per-playthrough setting.
 *         E.g. the plugin command could be used at the start of the game.
 *
 *         Note that Active & Wait modes offer different tactics.
 *         This feature may affect your game's balance.
 *
 *  • M12: Normally states reset their turn counter when applied.
 *         Now states add their Min Turns when applied, up to their Max Turns.
 *         E.g. a state with duration 2~5 will add 2 turns per apply, up to 5.
 *
 *  • M13: Changes the number of steps between random encounters at rate R.
 *         The plugin parameter determines the multiplier, M.
 *           - Original: min = 1, max = 2R - 1.
 *           - Adjusted: min = R, max = MR.
 *         The random distribution (binomial) is unchanged.
 *
 *  • M14: Actions with speed > 0 give a TPB charge boost next turn.
 *         The boost scales linearly, from:
 *           - +0% at speed 0, to
 *           - +100% at or above "Instant Speed" (plugin parameter).
 *
 *  • M15: "Remove State X%" effects remove X% of the max turns of that state.
 *         The state is only removed if the turns are reduced to 0 or less.
 *
 *  • M16: An Enemy with a <actor: X> notetag will inherit from actor X.
 *         E.g. <actor: 1> copies the following from actor ID 1:
 *           - Base param values => replaces enemy values.
 *           - Plus param values => adds to enemy values, if any.
 *           - Traits            => adds to enemy traits.
 *           - Learned skills    => copied as "Add Skill" traits.
 *
 *  • M17: Adds follow-up notetags for Skills/Items:
 *           - <follow-up>          => follows up with random known skill
 *           - <follow-up: A, B, C> => follows up with skill ID A, B, or C.
 *             E.g. <follow-up: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15>.
 *         A follow-up is a new action performed with the same target index.
 *         Follow-ups that cannot be used will be omitted from the pool.
 *
 *         For enemies, "random known skill" is based on Add Skill traits.
 *         If using with enemies, feature D05 is also recommended!
 *
 *  • M18: Adds notetags for "X Random" scope Skills/Items:
 *           - <forbid repeats>
 *               Cannot hit the same target twice.
 *               Target count will be reduced if necessary.
 *           - <avoid repeats>
 *               Will distribute hits evenly over the available targets.
 *               E.g. 6 hits for 3 targets => hits each target twice.
 *
 *  • M19: Skills/Items with a "Add State: Normal Attack" effect are attacks:
 *           - They gain "Attack Speed" and "Attack Times+" modifiers.
 *           - They use the attack motion in sideview battles.
 *
 *  • M20: Adds notetag <cast state: X, X, X> for Skills/Items.
 *         E.g. <cast state: 5> => add state 5 while casting this skill.
 *
 *         Specified state IDs will be:
 *           - Added when TPB casting starts; and
 *           - Reset to their previous turn count when TPB casting ends.
 *         Note that the casting phase only occurs:
 *           - In battle; and
 *           - For Items/Skills with Invocation Speed < 0.
 *
 *  • M21: Adds <HRG element: X> notetag for any trait-bearing object.
 *         All HP Regen traits (HRG) on that object count as element ID X.
 *         This allows for elemental damage over time.
 *
 *  • M22: Enables state stacks based on remaining turns:
 *           - <stack: X>
 *               State stacks := ceil(turns / X). [ceil = round up to integer.]
 *               E.g. <stack: 3> with 5 turns duration means 2 stacks.
 *           - <stack>
 *               Equivalent to <stack: 1>.
 *
 *  • M23: Inverts certain effects on opponent-scoped Skills/Items:
 *           - Gain TP
 *           - Grow
 *         By default the editor only lets you input positive values for these.
 *         E.g. Gain 10 TP becomes Lose 10 TP on a Skill with Scope: 1 Enemy.
 *
 *  • M24: Adds <guard skill: X> notetag for any trait-bearing object.
 *         E.g. <guard skill: 10> makes the bearer use skill 10 for Guard.
 *         If multiple tags apply, the one with highest skill ID is used.
 *
 *  • M25: Adds <no weapon> notetag for Skills/Items.
 *         Ignores traits from equipped Weapons for this action.
 *
 *  • M26: Automatically adds values to speed when on bush and/or ladder tiles.
 *         Applies to all characters.
 *         Speed additions can be customised in the plugin parameters.
 *
 *  • M27: Allows controlling battle item access via a skill type:
 *           - Define a skill type with the same name as your Item command.
 *           - Seal that skill type to prevent use of items in battle.
 *         The skill type will be hidden in-game.
 *
 *         Optional: require actors to have the Item skill type to use items.
 *
 *  • M28: Change the maxSavefiles count: affects save/load screens.
 *         Load Game can be set to auto-select Autosave if it is more recent.
 *
 *  • M29: Adds custom skill cost handling and display.
 *
 *         Custom types are defined in the plugin parameters. Presets:
 *           - MP, TP:              as usual.
 *           - HP:                  costs HP, allows KO.
 *           - Item, Weapon, Armor: costs inventory items, "ext" = item ID.
 *           - Money:               costs currency.
 *           - Variable:            usable if variable >= cost, -cost on use.
 *           - Warmup:              usable in battle when turn > cost.
 *           - Cooldown:            must wait "cost" battle turns between uses.
 *
 *         Costs are defined per skill using a Skill notetag in the form:
 *            <cost: type ext: jsCost>
 *         This tag can span multiple lines; each cost type occupies 1 line.
 *           - type     Replace this with a cost type.
 *           - ext      An optional value used for extra info, e.g. item ID.
 *           - jsCost   A JavaScript expression or function body.
 *                      The return keyword will be auto-prefixed if absent.
 *                      Form: (subject, item, ext) => number.
 *         Note: MP cost tags do not auto-scale with MP Cost Rate traits.
 *         Consider multiplying by "subject.mcr" in "jsCost" when appropriate.
 *
 *         Examples:
 *           - <cost: hp: 50>
 *               Costs 50 HP.
 *           - <cost:
 *               mp: return Math.round(subject.mmp / 4);
 *               item 5: 1
 *               item 2: 2
 *             >
 *               Costs 25% max MP, 1x item ID 5, and 2x item ID 2.
 *
 *  • M30: Causes an actor to be "formation-locked" if:
 *           - They are in a "Locked Position" (see plugin parameter); or
 *           - They have at least one object with a <lock formation> notetag.
 *         Locked actors:
 *           - Cannot be rearranged via the Formation menu command.
 *           - Will display a "locked" image on their status block.
 *         The image's appearance can be customised via plugin parameters.
 *
 *  • M31: Affects event-follower collisions:
 *           - Allows Event Touch to trigger on collision with follower.
 *           - Alternatively, followers can be marked non-collidable.
 *         Configure this via its plugin parameter.
 *
 *  • M32: Normally events "lock" while processing. This involves:
 *           - Pausing their autonomous move route.
 *           - Facing the player on activation.
 *         This feature disables the "face player" aspect for events that:
 *           - Have a "_noLock = true" property (see next paragraph);
 *           - Have a <no lock> tag in their Note box; and/or
 *           - Have a <no lock> tag in any Comment on their active page.
 *         For optimal use, place any comment tag near the top of its page.
 *
 *         The _noLock property can be set manually, e.g.
 *           - $gameMap.event(3)._noLock = true;
 *                   [Can use anywhere.] Affects map event ID 3.
 *           - this._noLock = true;
 *               [Only in a move route.] Affects the event being moved.
 *           - this.character(0)._noLock = true;
 *                [In a Script command.] Affects "This Event".
 *         If set to false instead, it will negate any <no lock> tag present.
 *
 *         _noLock will reset with the event: on leaving the map, by default.
 *         Alternatively, it can be reset manually, e.g.
 *           - delete $gameMap.event(3)._noLock;
 *           - delete this._noLock;
 *           - delete this.character(0)._noLock;
 *
 *  • M33: Customisable auto-battle AI.
 *           - Define per-target evaluation functions in the parameters.
 *           - These return a numerical score for damage formula/effects.
 *           - Formula/effect evaluations combine as per the Combine parameter.
 *         All usable actions will be tested against all viable targets.
 *         For "all" scope skills, per-target evaluations will be summed.
 *         The AI will use the action with the highest evaluation score.
 *
 *         The preset parameter values (mostly blank) mimic the core engine.
 *         By default, only HP Damage/Recover/Drain formulae are evaluated.
 *
 *         NB: the core engine still adds a random 0~1 to the final result.
 *         You can scale up evaluations (e.g. multiply by 10) to minimise this.
 *
 *         Adds <ai strictness: X> notetag for trait objects. E.g.
 *            - <ai strictness: 80>
 *                Multiplies the result by 0.8 ~ 1 (random).
 *         Multiple tags combine multiplicatively, e.g. 50 and 50 => 25%.
 *
 *         The "Rating Ext" parameter lets you pre-calculate custom values.
 *         These are calculated just before an action begins evaluation.
 *         The values are available in all rating functions as "ext".
 *         The "ext" argument is an ordered array containing all custom values.
 *         E.g. for estimating evade chance.
 *
 *         Optional: this can be applied to enemies with an Auto Battle trait.
 *         Enemies using Auto Battle AI will ignore their action patterns.
 *         Instead they will look at their Add Skill traits.
 *         Otherwise they will behave exactly the same as Auto Battle actors.
 *
 *  • M34: Adds notetags for any trait-bearing object:
 *           - <boost escape: X>
 *               Increases escape chance by X percentage points for bearer.
 *               E.g. <boost escape: 50> => +50%pt escape chance.
 *           - <block escape: X>
 *               Decreases escape chance by X percentage points for opponents.
 *               Does not apply when under the Cannot Move restriction.
 *               E.g. <block escape: 100> => -100%pt chance for any foe escape.
 *           - <block escape immobile: X>
 *               Like <block escape>, except it works even when Cannot Move.
 *         These tags apply to the Escape party command.
 *         They can optionally also apply to the Escape effect on Items/Skills.
 *
 *         Usually, the party escape chance (a.k.a. "escape ratio") is:
 *           - Calculated at the start of battle; and
 *           - Increased by a bonus of +10%pt per failed escape.
 *         It can be set to recalculate per attempt via the parameters →
 *         In that case, the stacking +10%pt bonus is effectively disabled.
 *
 *  • M35: Implements switch-based party commands.
 *         Each such party command is assigned a switch:
 *           - The command is enabled when the switch is off;
 *           - Command OK turns on the switch and checks for troop events.
 *
 *         Party commands can be added/removed mid-game using plugin commands.
 *         Designed for e.g. unique boss mechanics or special party abilities.
 *         Feature D01 (copy troop events) may be useful.
 *
 *  • M36: Adds a command window on the Gameover screen.
 *         Available commands:
 *           - title   = returns to title.
 *           - retry   = loads save with most recent timestamp.
 *           - load    = opens the load menu.
 *           - options = opens the options menu.
 *         For better control of the retry command, consider feature D21.
 *
 *         The window position and commands can be customised via parameters.
 *         The window will open after a delay, or on user OK/touch.
 *         A delay of 0 means it will wait for user input.
 *
 *         If no commands are enabled, it will proceed to the title screen.
 *         If only 1 command is present, it will auto-OK after the delay.
 *
 *  • M37: Specified switches and/or variables persist across playthroughs.
 *         There are 2 types, set up via the plugin parameters:
 *           - Persistent:  value silently persists across playthroughs.
 *                          e.g. for unlockables.
 *           - Game Option: adds a setting to the in-game options menu.
 *                          e.g. for custom settings.
 *
 *         Persistence will only work correctly via standard access.
 *         Fetching raw "_data" with script calls may give strange results.
 *
 *  • M38: Adds the <transform: ID> notetag for States.
 *         Adding a tagged state to an actor makes them "transform".
 *         Erasing the state makes them revert to their pre-transform self.
 *           - E.g. <transform: 5>   => transform into actor ID 5
 *
 *         Transformation applies these commands, copying from the given actor:
 *           - Change Name
 *           - Change Nickname
 *           - Change Class
 *           - Change Actor Images
 *           - Change Profile
 *         Note: these commands are performed again if/when the transform ends!
 *
 *         Effects after "Add State" will apply to the transformed battler.
 *         E.g. for a skill that transforms, then heals.
 *
 *
 *  • Q01: Plugin parameter value for volume step size on options screen.
 *         Also adds horizontal touch-drag input support for all settings.
 *
 *         Step size is automatically set to 1 in the following cases:
 *           - When holding the dash button ("shift").
 *           - During horizontal touch-drag.
 *
 *  • Q02: Shows battle animations, state overlay, etc on actor faces.
 *         For front-view battle.
 *         (Normally animations etc on actors only show in side-view.)
 *
 *  • Q03: Extends the pause menu status screen:
 *           - Display different actor param values (see plugin parameter).
 *           - Allow selection & scrolling of param/equip sub-windows.
 *           - Add new sub-windows in a horizontally-scrolling "belt".
 *
 *         New status sub-windows display element rates and state rates.
 *         Element/state names are matched against patterns to affect display:
 *           - The EXCLUDE pattern hides that element/state.
 *           - The HEADING pattern centres the name and hides its rate.
 *         If all elements/states are excluded, that window will not appear.
 *
 *         This feature has several parameters for customisation.
 *
 *  • Q04: Skips blank Show Text messages.
 *         By default, affects all standard $gameMessage calls.
 *         Can be set to only affect standard battle start messages.
 *
 *  • Q05: Shows MHP, MMP, HIT, and EVA params on equip scene.
 *         Also shows active state/buff icons.
 *         Replaces equip scene face with a background portrait.
 *           - Portrait: "img/pictures/<faceName>_<faceIndex+1>".
 *           - E.g. "img/pictures/Actor1_1" for the 1st face of set "Actor1".
 *
 *  • Q06: Pauses audio & video when game loses focus.
 *         Normally the game pauses only its mechanical loop and Effekseer.
 *
 *  • Q07: Disables WindowLayer masking.
 *         This means game windows may be seen under other game windows.
 *         E.g. when selecting an actor target in battle or from inventory.
 *         It typically improves rendering times.
 *
 *  • Q08: Select final item when cursorDown fails in selectable windows.
 *         E.g. if the last item is in the first column:
 *           => it can now be selected by scrolling down in ANY column.
 *
 *  • Q09: Process text codes in any game window.
 *         This will disable horizontal text "squashing" in narrow areas.
 *         Legacy mode will affect only the currency & enemy select windows.
 *         Note that this does not affect refresh timings, e.g.
 *           - \v[x] will not necessarily redraw when variable x changes.
 *
 *         Known limitations:
 *           - Sprite_Name (battle status) only accepts "convert" codes.
 *             E.g. \i[n] and \c[n] will be removed, but \v[n] will work.
 *           - Other sprites, e.g. gauge labels, do not support text codes.
 *
 *  • Q10: Disables map fast-forward behaviour, i.e.
 *         2x speed while OK/touch is long-pressed during non-Parallel event.
 *
 *  • Q11: Adds notetags for Skills, Items, or any trait-bearing object:
 *           - <attack anim base: X>
 *               E.g. <attack anim base: 5>.
 *               Defines base attack animation ID.
 *               Combines with default attack animation ID.
 *               The highest value from default and tags is used.
 *           - <attack anim plus: X>
 *               E.g. <attack anim plus: 2>.
 *               Defines additive offset to attack animation ID.
 *               Ignored if base animation ID is 0 (i.e. None).
 *               The highest value from all tags is used (default +0).
 *         Tags on Skills/Items take priority over trait objects.
 *         Offsets are designed for use with elemental power-ups.
 *
 *         Also, enemies now have attack animations (default ID 1).
 *
 *  • Q12: Show "Quit Game" command on title and via pause menu.
 *         Closes the game window, ending the play session.
 *         Does not apply for web games.
 *
 *  • Q13: Show weather effects in battle.
 *         Also enables the Change Weather command in battle.
 *
 *  • Q14: Adds some new text codes for use in Show Text:
 *           - \AF[n]          (e.g. \af[1] for actor 1's face)
 *               Redraws message face as actor ID n.
 *           - \PF[n]          (e.g. \pf[1] for leader's face)
 *               Redraws message face as party member n: 1 = leader.
 *           - \S[n]           (e.g. \s[5] for slower text)
 *               Sets wait time between characters: min 1 frame.
 *           - \ALIGN[0|1|2]   (e.g. \align[1] for centre)
 *               Aligns message text to left|middle|right respectively.
 *         Feature D16 is recommended if using text alignment.
 *
 *  • Q15: Visually group duplicate drops in battle reward message.
 *         Formatting can be customised with the plugin parameter.
 *
 *  • Q16: Adds in-game option to toggle audio dynamic range compression.
 *         This reduces the volume difference between quiet and loud sounds.
 *         Compressor settings & option display are adjustable via parameters.
 *
 *  • Q17: Adds a help window to the options scene.
 *         Customise descriptions via the plugin parameter.
 *         The preset values support all defaults and extras from this plugin.
 *
 *  • Q18: Adds notetag for enemies, on Enemy or State objects:
 *           - <ghost: X>
 *               E.g. <ghost: 0.8>   = show affected enemy at 80% opacity.
 *         When multiple tags apply, their values multiply.
 *
 *  • Q19: Render at integer coordinates only, to avoid blurring.
 *         E.g. centred Show Choices can become blurred in certain situations.
 *
 *  • Q20: Show remaining turns on state/buff icons in battle.
 *         A state with:
 *           - No auto-removal timing will show the Unlimited Turns value.
 *           - A <hide turns> notetag won't show its remaining turns.
 *
 *  • Q21: Applies low-pass filter for BGS on maps with notetag <muffleBGS>.
 *         Designed to create a "muffled" effect, e.g. for indoors rain BGS.
 *
 *  • Q22: Moves all enemies toward the bottom of the screen.
 *         Normally you can't place enemies behind the status window at all.
 *         Damage popups are adjusted to avoid showing behind that window.
 *
 *  • Q23: Applies draw offsets to tiles based on their terrain tag.
 *         Does not affect passability.
 *         E.g. half-tile offset down for more natural furniture positions.
 *         Tiles offset left or down draw on top of other tiles on that layer.
 *
 *         Also adds note/comment tag for events:
 *           - <offset: X, Y>
 *               E.g. <offset: 0, 24>   = place sprite 24 px further down.
 *               Character will be visually offset by +X px, +Y px.
 *         For tile events, both tile and tag offsets apply.
 *
 *  • Q24: Hide MP or TP gauges with a maximum value of 0.
 *         E.g. as seen in the pause menu and battle status.
 *
 *  • Q25: Display fixed-value segments for (selected) gauges.
 *         Value per segment can be customised via the plugin parameter.
 *
 *  • Q26: Shows a "saving" indicator image when the game saves.
 *         The image fades in, then fades out.
 *         Other aspects can be customised via the plugin parameters.
 *
 *         If the image is in "img/system/", it will remain in cache.
 *
 *  • Q27: Touch UI will immediately hide when turned off in the options.
 *
 *  • Q28: If config file is not found on boot, options will show first.
 *         On exiting options, user settings are saved to the config file.
 *
 *  • Q29: Show 1+ splash screen(s) before the title.
 *         Each one can use a static image (fade in/out) or a video.
 *         Each one can play an ME track on start, and/or a BGM track.
 *         Configure these in the plugin parameters.
 *
 *         Will show before the built-in splash (v1.8.0), if that is enabled.
 *
 *  • Q30: Show gauges (e.g. HP) for enemies in battle.
 *         Adds notetags for Enemies:
 *           - <gauge offset: X, Y>
 *               E.g. <gauge offset: 50, -100>
 *               Move this enemy's gauges an extra 50 px right & 100 px up.
 *           - <gauge width scale: X>
 *               E.g. <gauge width scale: 1.2>
 *               This enemy's gauges will be 120% of the usual width.
 *         Various settings can be configured in the plugin parameters.
 *
 *  • Q31: Move with WASD or arrows.
 *         Maps E to "pagedown", because normally W is "pagedown".
 *
 *  • Q32: Adds event notetag for sprite hue shift:
 *           - <hue: H, D>
 *               E.g. <hue: 50>     = shift hue by a constant +50°.
 *               E.g. <hue: 0, 2>   = hue starts at 0°, +1° every 2 frames.
 *
 *  • Q33: Show Text in a Parallel event will act as a background/auto-message.
 *         The window fades in/out, with the text displayed immediately.
 *         Text codes specific to Show Text, e.g. \$, will generally not work.
 *
 *         Special text code properties:
 *           - \AF[n]   Sets auto-message face to actor ID n.
 *           - \PF[n]   Sets auto-message face to party member n (1 = leader).
 *           - \^       Continue this event while the auto-message is showing.
 *                      E.g. to queue multiple auto-messages at once.
 *           - \.       Additional "short" duration (see below).
 *           - \|       Additional "long" duration (see below).
 *           - \!       Wait until next auto-message instead of fixed duration.
 *
 *         Message duration is determined by a plugin parameter.
 *         There are 3 durations to specify:
 *           - Base:  minimum duration for all auto-messages.
 *           - Long:  additional duration per use of \| in the message.
 *           - Short: additional duration per use of \. in the message.
 *
 *  • Q34: Represents cast time as an overlay on the TPB charge gauge.
 *
 *  • Q35: Adds 2 notetags for any trait-bearing object.
 *           - <death var: X, Y>
 *               E.g. <death var: 2, 1>
 *               Adds Y to variable ID X when the bearer dies.
 *               If Y is omitted, a value of 1 will be used.
 *           - <death anim: X>
 *               E.g. <death anim: 120>
 *               Plays animation ID X on the bearer when they die.
 *         These tags help to avoid the Immortal state workaround.
 *
 *  • Q36: Show Picture "snapshot.png" takes a snapshot of the scene.
 *         That snapshot can be moved etc with the usual picture controls.
 *
 *         Up to 1 snapshot can exist per picture ID.
 *         Delete a snapshot using Show Picture or Erase Picture on that ID.
 *         Existing snapshots are included in save data.
 *
 *         Supports optional filename prefixes "$" and "!".
 *         E.g. "!snapshot.png", for compatibility with feature D13.
 *
 *         This feature does not offer export of snapshots to disk.
 *
 *         Known issue: when swapping for a snapshot, the previous image may
 *            briefly display with the snapshot's coordinates/origin/etc.
 *
 *  • Q37: Adds closed orbital motion note/comment tag for events.
 *         <orbit: id, R, T, A>:
 *           - id   ID of character to orbit:
 *                     1+ = event ID,
 *                     0  = screen centre,
 *                    -1  = player,
 *                    -n  = follower n-1 (-2 = first follower, etc).
 *           - R    Radius of circular orbit (px).
 *                  Optional. If omitted: 1 tile.
 *                  Sign affects direction: ↻ > 0, ↺ < 0.
 *                  Alternatively, can be written as Rx:Ry (elliptic orbit).
 *                  Rx = X radius, Ry = Y radius. Same-sign ↻, else ↺.
 *           - T    Period of simple orbit (frames).
 *                  Optional. If omitted: 60 frames.
 *                  Alternatively, can be written as Tx:Ty.
 *                  Tx = X period, Ty = Y period.
 *           - A    Inclination of orbit's X axis (degrees).
 *                  Optional. If omitted: 0°.
 *                  No effect for simple circular orbits, due to symmetry.
 *
 *         Some examples:
 *           - <orbit: -1, 48, 120>
 *               Orbit player, 48 px ↻ circle, 1 cycle every 120 frames.
 *           - <orbit: 4, 96:0, 60, 45>
 *               Orbit event 4, 96 px ↘diagonal↖, 1 cycle every 60 frames.
 *           - <orbit: -1, -200, 100:125>
 *               Orbit player, 200 px radius ↺ loop, 1 cycle every 500 frames.
 *
 *         An orbit event will trigger on collision with the player if:
 *           - It has trigger Player Touch or Event Touch; and
 *           - It has at least 1 command on its active page.
 *         Be careful to change page or something to avoid a soft-lock.
 *
 *  • Q38: Changes dash behaviour for touch-based movement.
 *         Now touch must be released before selecting a new move destination.
 *         This avoids unintended movement due to map scroll.
 *
 *         Optionally adds a new "dash" input: long-press touch while moving.
 *         The default dash inputs are:
 *           - Holding the "shift" button.
 *           - The "Always Dash" option.
 *         If 1 or 3 of these are met, the player will dash.
 *         If 0 or 2 of these are met, the player will walk.
 *
 *  • Q39: Shows skill names for Attack and Guard battle commands.
 *         Skill icons show if the database command name starts with "\i[".
 *
 *  • Q40: Plays the Cursor SE when hover-selecting with touch/mouse.
 *
 *  • Q41: Colour map lighting scene shader. No shadow-casting.
 *         Implements 2 render modes: hard- and soft-edge.
 *         These can be toggled between using an in-game option.
 *
 *         Mark a map as "dark" using this map notetag:
 *           - <dark: r, g, b, a>
 *               Replace r, g, b, and a with red/green/blue/alpha (0~255).
 *               Defines the colour & opacity of darkness for this map.
 *               E.g. <dark: 0, 0, 51, 192> is dark blue, ~75% opacity.
 *           - <dark: r, g, b>
 *               Equivalent to <dark: r, g, b, 255>, i.e. opaque colour.
 *           - <dark: s>
 *               Equivalent to <dark: s, s, s, 255>, i.e. opaque monochrome.
 *           - <dark>
 *               Equivalent to <dark: 0, 0, 0, 255>, i.e. opaque black.
 *
 *         Lights can be designated for:
 *           - Events, via notetag or comment tag.
 *           - Trait-bearing objects, via notetag.
 *         The tag is <light: radius, r, g, b, a, dir>:
 *           - radius  Radius of light source (px).
 *           - r       Red value (0~255).
 *           - g       Green value (0~255).
 *           - b       Blue value (0~255).
 *           - a       Intensity/alpha (0~255).
 *           - dir     0 for point source, 1 for FoV arc.
 *         Examples:
 *           - <light: 96, 255, 255, 255, 51>
 *               20% white, 96 px radius, point source.
 *           - <light: 192, 255, 255, 0, 128>
 *               50% yellow, 192 px radius, point source.
 *           - <light: 300, 128, 0, 255, 128, 1>
 *               50% blue/blue/red, 300 px radius, frontal arc.
 *
 *         The notetag <dim: X> reduces the bearer's <light> intensity.
 *         This tag is for any trait-bearing object on actors.
 *         On the party leader, it will also affect the natural FoV.
 *         E.g. <dim: 50> => -50 to intensity/alpha of all bearer's sources.
 *         Resultant intensity will be clamped to the range 0~255.
 *
 *         Various aspects can be customised via the plugin parameters.
 *         There are plugin commands to set/reset the dark colour mid-game.
 *
 *  • Q42: Skips Buy/Sell/Cancel for purchase- or sell-only shops.
 *         In this case, a "sell-only" shop is one that:
 *           - Is not marked Purchase Only; and
 *           - Has no goods for sale.
 *
 *  • Q43: Adds a Game Speed in-game option.
 *         E.g. for accessibility or speedruns.
 *         To reduce audio desync, consider also enabling feature D07.
 *
 *  • Q44: Places the Guard actor battle command immediately below Attack.
 *
 *  • Q45: Show vertical scroll indicators on eligible selectable windows.
 *         Appearance can be customised via plugin parameters.
 *
 *  • Q46: Remodels the main window on the status scene:
 *           - Stretches gauges to fill more space.
 *           - Optionally replaces "EXP To Next" with "EXP For Next".
 *           - Optionally adds a new EXP gauge.
 *         Can be customised via the plugin parameters.
 *
 *  • Q47: Adds an in-game option to toggle full-screen.
 *         Should track any fullscreen change (e.g. F4) and update accordingly.
 *
 *  • Q48: Custom cursor PNG, with optional "press" and "cancel" variants.
 *         Offers optional in-game setting to let the player choose a cursor.
 *         An inactivity period can also be set, after which the cursor hides.
 *
 *         Recommended maximum size is 32x32 px for security/compatibility.
 *         E.g. see the fixed Chromium issues linked here:
 *           - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1246188
 *
 *  • Q49: Adds various choice-related options, configurable via parameters:
 *
 *           - Vertically centre "message free" choices relative to the screen.
 *             (Normally choices locate at the message, even if it's closed.)
 *
 *           - Horizontally align choice text to match its window.
 *
 *           - Merge consecutive Show Choices commands.
 *             The first command in a merged block decides style, align, etc.
 *             For Cancel: Branch, all cancel branches will trigger, in order.
 *
 *           - Hide and/or disable choices with plugin commands.
 *
 *           - Randomly shuffle the displayed order of choices.
 *             Toggle on/off with a plugin command.
 *
 *           - Show choices inlined within the message window, if present.
 *             Toggle on/off with a plugin command.
 *
 *           - Show a simple help window with different text for each choice.
 *             Help text is defined in a "Comment" immediately after "When X".
 *             E.g. Comment: Help:
 *                  :      : This is a good choice!
 *                  :      : You should definitely pick it.
 *             The help window will be hidden for choices that lack help text.
 *
 *  • Q50: Menu arrangement settings:
 *           - Alternative command position  (right ↔ left).
 *           - Alternative help position     (bottom ↔ top).
 *           - Alternative Touch UI position (top ↔ bottom).
 *           - New "mini-help" window between Touch UI buttons on menu scenes.
 *
 *         The mini-help window shows user-defined text on a per-scene basis.
 *         Text is defined via a generator function.
 *         This allows showing a (potentially endless) sequence of texts, e.g.
 *             yield "Hello!";
 *             yield "This is a menu.";
 *             return "";
 *         The text update frequency can be adjusted in the plugin parameters.
 *         The window will only remain open while its text is not blank.
 *
 *  • Q51: Adds a master volume setting to the in-game options menu.
 *
 *  • Q52: Adds customisable categories to the in-game options menu.
 *         See the plugin parameters for details.
 *
 *  • Q53: Adds a \T message text code that allows for "hover tips".
 *         E.g. Show Text: Would you like a \T[cookie]?
 *         Displays as:   "Would you like a cookie?"
 *         However, if you hover the word "cookie", a tip can appear.
 *         E.g. cookie -> "A tasty snack that restores \c[23]50 MP\c[0]."
 *
 *         This feature's plugin parameters let you:
 *           - Define hover tips for given \T[phrases];
 *           - Define a button to navigate through tips, in order;
 *           - Customise the appearance of the tip window.
 *
 *         By default the hover tip will "cut through" other windows behind it.
 *         Feature Q07 is recommended to avoid this.
 *
 *  • Q54: Customise in-game option display values:
 *           - Optionally replace the "ON" and/or "OFF" texts.
 *           - Optionally add background gauges for volume options.
 *         See the plugin parameters for details.
 *
 *  • Q55: Optionally adds state overlays for:
 *           - Enemies in battle; and
 *           - Party members on the map.
 *
 *
 *  • D01: Troop events from troop 1 are prefixed to all troops.
 *
 *  • D02: Adds a line-of-sight method to Game_CharacterBase:
 *           - char1.los(char2, fov) => true|false
 *         Line-of-sight is blocked based on plugin parameters:
 *           - Opaque Regions  = a list of region IDs; and
 *           - Is LoS Blocked  = a scripted function.
 *         By default, "Is LoS Blocked" counts these as blocking:
 *           - "Shadowing" tiles, i.e. walls and wall-tops; and
 *           - Characters that could collide with the observer.
 *
 *         Script call examples:
 *           - Can the player see map event 5, default FoV?
 *               $gamePlayer.los($gameMap.event(5))                  [anywhere]
 *           - Can the character being moved see the player, 60° FoV?
 *               this.los($gamePlayer, 60)                         [move route]
 *           - Can This Event see the player, 150° FoV?
 *               this.character(0).los($gamePlayer, 150)       [Script command]
 *
 *         Optionally enables a <los> comment/note tag for events.
 *         This triggers a result when the event sees the player.
 *           - <los: result>
 *               Single result, default range, default FoV.
 *           - <los: result, range>
 *               Single result, specified range (px), default FoV.
 *           - <los: result, range, fov>
 *               Single result, specified range (px), specified FoV (degrees).
 *           - <los: result, result, range, fov>
 *               Multiple results, etc.
 *         Replace "result" with one of the following:
 *           - 0    => trigger this event;
 *           - 1+   => turn on that switch;
 *           - A~D  => turn on that self-switch.
 *         If "range" or "fov" are 0, their defaults will be used instead:
 *           - Default range = infinite;
 *           - Default FoV   = plugin parameter.
 *         Examples:
 *           - <los: 4>
 *               Turn on switch ID 4 when the player is seen.
 *           - <los: B, 200>
 *               Turn on self-switch B when the player is seen within 200 px.
 *           - <los: 0, 0, 90>
 *               Trigger this event on seeing the player in a 90° frontal arc.
 *           - <los: 25, 0, 240, 0>
 *               Turn on switch 25 then trigger this event; 240 px range.
 *         Sight is checked every frame: be careful of soft-locks!
 *
 *  • D03: Adds a safety check for when the ConfigManager fails to save.
 *         E.g. for web games, when the browser denies local storage access.
 *         That typically causes the game to crash.
 *         This feature catches the error and shows a message instead.
 *
 *  • D04: Effects from Item 1 are prefixed to all other Items and Skills.
 *
 *  • D05: Normally _targetIndex is always -1 (random) for enemy actions.
 *         This feature sets _targetIndex when appropriate.
 *         This makes no difference by itself.
 *         Recommended for compatibility with features like M17 (follow-ups).
 *
 *  • D06: Tracks multiple HP, MP, and/or TP changes per action result.
 *         Test case: any action with multiple HP/MP/TP changes, e.g.
 *           - Formula + effect.
 *           - Multiple effects.
 *         Normally all changes are applied, but only the latest one is shown.
 *         This feature adds the results together so the total is displayed.
 *
 *  • D07: Affects audio pitch:
 *           - Changing the pitch of a playing track will not make it restart.
 *           - Pitch will scale with the app's ticker speed, to avoid desync.
 *
 *  • D08: Opposed pairs of "Last" data will reset one another, i.e.
 *           - Setting "Last Used Skill"    will set "Last Used Item"     to 0.
 *           - Setting "Last Subject Actor" will set "Last Subject Enemy" to 0.
 *           - Setting "Last Target Actor"  will set "Last Target Enemy"  to 0.
 *         ...and vice versa.
 *
 *  • D09: Allows drawing faces from enemy images.
 *         Face "$NAME$X-Y-S.png" will draw:
 *           - A face-sized output area;
 *           - With source top-left at (X, Y);
 *           - From "img/enemies/subfolders/NAME.png";
 *           - Upscaled by factor S (optional).
 *         X, Y, and S must be non-negative integers.
 *         Only 1 such face can exist per enemy image.
 *
 *  • D10: When an enemy picks skill 1, they'll use their current Attack skill.
 *         When an enemy picks skill 2, they'll use their current Guard skill.
 *
 *  • D11: Tile events contribute flags associated with their tile.
 *         Flags: ladder, bush, counter, damage floor.
 *
 *  • D12: Adds plugin commands to force party/troop advantage for next battle.
 *         Resets on:
 *           - Battle start.
 *           - New/Load game.
 *           - End of play session.
 *         Designed to be used immediately before a Battle Processing command.
 *
 *  • D13: Show Picture "!picture.png" pins to the map instead of the screen.
 *         Note that Show/Move Picture use screen coordinates, regardless.
 *
 *  • D14: Support showing left/right arrows on game windows.
 *         This is a resource, it does nothing by itself.
 *         Feature Q03 will use this if available.
 *
 *  • D15: Includes trace in applicable error messages in-game.
 *         Automatically opens dev tools on error during playtest.
 *         Also adds a "Copy to Clipboard" button for ease of reporting.
 *
 *         For a test case, you can try this in a Script command:
 *            throw new Error("Oh no!");
 *
 *  • D16: Prevents processing message text codes during measurement.
 *         This has no in-game effect by itself.
 *         Recommended for use with Q14 due to its alignment checks.
 *
 *  • D17: Merges BGM Volume and ME Volume into a single setting.
 *         Removes ME Volume from the in-game options menu.
 *         Reasoning:
 *           - MEs will generally be volume-balanced with their BGMs.
 *           - Many players don't know what a Music Effect is.
 *           - Simpler UI due to 1 less in-game option.
 *
 *  • D18: Adds troop name tag <add: X, X, X>.
 *         E.g. <add: 5, 6>.
 *         Adds all enemies from those troop IDs to this troop.
 *         Designed to bypass the editor's limit of 8 enemies per troop.
 *         Enemies will NOT be automatically repositioned.
 *
 *  • D19: Allows multiple move commands to process per frame.
 *         "Long" moves are commands that take 1+ frames to complete:
 *           - Move Up/Down/Left/Right/diagonal.
 *           - Jump.
 *           - Wait.
 *         All other move commands are considered to be "short".
 *         Requirements for a move command to immediately go to the next:
 *           - Command did NOT cause route to change; and
 *           - Command caused route index to change; and
 *           - Command movement succeeded (if short) or failed (if long).
 *
 *  • D20: Adds plugin command for enemy reinforcements.
 *         This adds all enemies from the specified troop, mid-battle.
 *         Enemies will NOT be automatically repositioned.
 *
 *  • D21: Adds plugin commands for synchronous save/load. Example uses:
 *           - a save point that saves to the most recent slot;
 *           - a scripted "autosave";
 *           - a forced reload after defeat by a boss.
 *         Also allows excluding autosaves from the Save Count statistic.
 *
 *  • D22: Normally, switches/variables fire onChange when they change value.
 *         That tells the map to refresh at the start of the next frame.
 *         A map refresh includes checking all event page conditions.
 *         HUD plugins etc might also update based on this.
 *
 *         This feature lets you skip onChange for specific switches/variables.
 *         It is based on a pattern matched against the switch/variable name.
 *         The default pattern is "^#", matching any name starting with "#".
 *
 *         This is designed for switches/variables that:
 *           - update often (e.g. a background timer); and
 *           - are never used as event page conditions.
 *
 *  • D23: Replaces Math.randomInt with a cryptographic source (CSPRNG).
 *         This affects sources like Control Variables > Random.
 *         It requires more CPU than the usual method.
 *         It's mostly experimental.
 *         If your game has a LOT of randomness, this may be worth trying out?
 *
 *         Technically, compared to a PRNG, a CSPRNG produces results that:
 *           - meet a higher standard of statistical randomness; and
 *           - are less mutually-dependent.
 *         More details:

 *  • D24: Adds plugin commands to precache maps, images, and/or audio.
 *         Resources can also be precached on game boot via plugin parameters.
 *         Resources cached like this persist until uncached (plugin command).
 *         Remember to uncache resources to free memory when appropriate!
 *
 *         Events already preload their facesets and pictures when they start.
 *         This uses the normal image cache, which clears on map transfer.
 *
 *         Images from "img/system/" are already persistently cached.
 *         Request once and they'll stay loaded for the rest of the session.
 *
 *         Audio is cached into static buffers:
 *           - normally an SE can play another instance before the first ends.
 *           - a static SE cannot have more than 1 instance playing at a time.
 *         System audio (Database > System 1) is already cached like that.
 *
 *  • D25: Normally Auto Battle only considers usable skills and Attack.
 *         With this feature, an actor will also consider their Guard skill.
 *
 *  • D26: Allows specifying custom default values for core options.
 *         E.g. make BGM Volume default to 20% instead of 100%.
 *
 *  • D27: Move Toward (and/or Away From) Character moves can use pathfinding.
 *         The search limit can be changed via a plugin parameter.
 *         Default limit is 12 tiles; path away will only use half the limit.
 *
 *         This feature uses the core, 4-directional, A* algorithm.
 *         Path away uses a similar algorithm with an inverted heuristic.
 *         Plugins that change the core algorithm will only affect path toward.
